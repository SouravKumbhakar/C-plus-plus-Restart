# Basics concepts of OOP in c++

### Classes
### Objects
### Abstraction
### Encapsulation
### Inheritance
### Polymorphism

## Classes
-----------

Classes are user defined data types that act as the blueprint for creating objects.

syntax for class is:

```cpp
class ClassName {
    // class body
};
``` 
## Objects
-----------

Objects are instances of classes.   
objects is any real world entity.

once we have a class, we can create objects from it.

syntax for creating an object is:

```cpp
ClassName objectName;
```
### Abstraction
-----------

Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex details and showing only essential features of an object.

Abstarction means what is to be done is specified but how it is done is hidden.

### Encapsulation
-----------

Encapsulation is the process of wrapping the data (attributes) and code (methods) that operates on the data into a single unit. 

it is use for hiding the internal details of an object and showing only the necessary details to the outside world.

### Inheritance
----------- 
Inheritance is the procssing of creating a new class from an existing class(old class/parent class/super class).    

### Polymorphism
-----------

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.


# Structure of a c++ program
-----------
>
### Documentations 
------------
    the documentation is the information about the program.
>
### preprocessor directives
------------
    the preprocessor directives are instructions that are processed before the compilation of the program.
    1. header file inclusion
    2. macro definition

>  
### class definition
------------
    the class definition is the definition of the class.  
>      
### member functions definition
------------
    the member functions definition is the definition of the member functions of the class.
>  
### main function  
------------
    the main function is the entry point of the program.
