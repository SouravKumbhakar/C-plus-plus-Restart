# Dynamic Initialisation of Variables 
-----------------------------------
Dynamic Initialisation means initialising the variable should be done at the time of declaration.   

### Here Dynamic means at the time of execution or runtime.

Example:
```cpp
int a = 10; // this is a static initialisation.
int b = 20; // this is a static initialisation.
``` 

Now the example of dynamic initialisation is:
```cpp
int a;
int b;
cin >> a >> b; // this is a dynamic initialisation.
```
